# Shot Pulling Guide

Master the art of espresso extraction with our equipment. This guide covers proper shot pulling techniques for both locations.

## The Perfect Shot Parameters

### Target Specifications
- **Dose:** 18g of coffee (double shot)
- **Yield:** 36g of espresso (1:2 ratio)
- **Time:** 25-30 seconds
- **Temperature:** 200-205°F (93-96°C)
- **Pressure:** 9 bars during extraction

### Visual Indicators
- **Pre-infusion:** Coffee should darken and swell
- **Flow:** Starts slow, becomes steady honey-like stream
- **Crema:** Golden-brown foam, 3-5mm thick
- **Color:** Rich amber to dark brown

## Prairie Kitchen - Bambino Plus Instructions

### Pre-Flight Check
1. **Machine Warm-Up**
   - Turn on machine (ready in 3 seconds)
   - Run blank shot to heat group head
   - Ensure water tank is full

2. **Prepare Workspace**
   - Clean portafilter and basket
   - Have shot glasses/cups ready
   - Start timer app if using

### Shot Pulling Process
1. **Grind and Dose**
   - Use Sette 270 to grind 18g into portafilter
   - Level grounds gently
   - Tamp with 30lbs pressure

2. **Insert Portafilter**
   - Lock portafilter into group head
   - Ensure tight seal
   - Position cup under spouts

3. **Start Extraction**
   - Press double shot button
   - Start timer
   - Watch initial flow

4. **Monitor Extraction**
   - **0-5 seconds:** Pre-infusion, coffee darkens
   - **5-10 seconds:** First drops appear
   - **10-25 seconds:** Steady honey-like flow
   - **25-30 seconds:** Stop extraction

5. **Evaluate Shot**
   - Check yield (should be ~36g)
   - Observe crema thickness and color
   - Taste for balance

### Troubleshooting Extractions

**Too Fast (Under 20 seconds)**
- Grind finer on Sette 270
- Increase dose slightly
- Check tamping pressure
- Ensure even distribution

**Too Slow (Over 35 seconds)**
- Grind coarser on Sette 270
- Decrease dose slightly
- Check for channeling
- Verify basket isn't clogged

## Owensmouth Kitchen - Barista Express Instructions

### Pre-Flight Check
1. **Machine Warm-Up**
   - Turn on machine
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for full heat-up
   - Check water tank and bean hopper

2. **Prepare for Extraction**
   - Clean portafilter and basket
   - Purge group head (run water briefly)
   - Have cups ready

### Shot Pulling Process
1. **Grind and Dose**
   - Set grind size (start at 5-7)
   - Grind directly into portafilter
   - Check dose weight (14-18g)

2. **Level and Tamp**
   - Level grounds with finger
   - Use integrated tamper
   - Apply firm, even pressure
   - Polish with slight twist

3. **Insert Portafilter**
   - Lock into group head firmly
   - Ensure proper seal
   - Position cup under spouts

4. **Start Extraction**
   - Press double shot button (or manual)
   - Start timing
   - Watch pressure gauge

5. **Monitor Flow**
   - **Pre-infusion:** Low pressure, coffee swells
   - **Extraction:** Pressure builds to 9 bars
   - **Flow:** Steady, honey-like consistency
   - **Finish:** Stop at target yield/time

### Using Manual Mode
1. **Press Manual Button**
   - Gives you full control
   - Start and stop extraction manually
   - Watch pressure gauge closely

2. **Control Extraction**
   - Start extraction
   - Monitor flow rate
   - Stop when you reach target yield
   - Typical time: 25-30 seconds

## Advanced Techniques

### Pre-Infusion
**What it is:** Low pressure water saturates coffee before full extraction
**Benefits:** More even extraction, better flavor
**How to use:** Both machines have automatic pre-infusion

### Pressure Profiling
**Barista Express:** Watch pressure gauge, aim for 9 bars
**Bambino Plus:** Automatic pressure control
**Goal:** Consistent pressure throughout extraction

### Temperature Surfing
**Not needed:** Both machines have stable temperature control
**Tip:** Let machine warm up fully before first shot

## Quality Control

### Tasting Notes
**Balanced Shot:**
- Sweet and smooth
- Pleasant acidity
- Rich body
- Clean finish

**Under-Extracted (Sour):**
- Sharp acidity
- Thin body
- Salty or sour taste
- Light crema

**Over-Extracted (Bitter):**
- Harsh bitterness
- Astringent finish
- Dark, thick crema
- Burnt taste

### Measuring Success
1. **Time the extraction** (25-30 seconds ideal)
2. **Weigh the output** (1:2 ratio target)
3. **Observe the crema** (golden-brown, 3-5mm)
4. **Taste and adjust** (balance is key)

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Channeling
**Symptoms:** Fast, uneven extraction, light spots in puck
**Solutions:**
- Improve distribution before tamping
- Check grind consistency
- Ensure level tamping
- Clean basket regularly

### Sour Shots
**Causes:** Under-extraction
**Solutions:**
- Grind finer
- Increase dose
- Check water temperature
- Extend extraction time

### Bitter Shots
**Causes:** Over-extraction
**Solutions:**
- Grind coarser
- Decrease dose
- Reduce extraction time
- Check bean freshness

### No Crema
**Causes:** Stale beans, poor extraction
**Solutions:**
- Use fresher beans (2-30 days post-roast)
- Check grind size
- Verify dose and tamp
- Clean machine

## Maintenance for Better Shots

### Daily
- Clean portafilter and baskets
- Purge group head
- Wipe down machine
- Empty drip tray

### Weekly
- Backflush group head
- Clean water tank
- Check for coffee residue
- Calibrate if needed

### Monthly
- Descale machine
- Replace water filter
- Deep clean all components
- Professional service check
