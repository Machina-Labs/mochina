### The Golden Ratio
- **Espresso:** 1:2 ratio (18g coffee → 36g espresso in 25-30 seconds)
- **Milk Drinks:** 1/3 espresso, 2/3 steamed milk
- **Americano:** 1:3 ratio (espresso to hot water)

### Key Variables
- **Grind Size:** Affects extraction speed and flavor
- **Dose:** Amount of coffee used (typically 18-20g for double shot)
- **Time:** Extraction time affects strength and flavor balance
- **Temperature:** Water temperature should be 200-205°F (93-96°C)

### Quality Indicators
- **Crema:** Golden-brown foam on top of espresso
- **Flow Rate:** Steady, honey-like pour from portafilter
- **Taste Balance:** Not too sour (under-extracted) or bitter (over-extracted)

## 🚨 Safety Reminders

- Always ensure water tanks are filled before operation
- Allow machines to heat up fully before use
- Never run grinders without beans
- Clean steam wands before and after each use
- Unplug equipment before deep cleaning
